Very detailed information of the system can be obtained from theoretical calculations, but a realistic model is dependent on an accurate computational method. Accurate calculations of core level electronic spectra, and evaluation of the modeling against experiments, are central parts of this work. The main tools used for characterization of the systems are high-level quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular components in solutions are involved in many key processes converting sunlight into chemical or electrical energy. Transition metal complexes, with their pronounced absorption in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum, are core components in various energy conversion applications, and the iodide/triiodide redox couple is a commonly used electrolyte. The local structure of the electronic valence in transition metal complexes and the details of the solvation mechanisms of electrolyte solutions are investigated through the combination of computational modeling and core level spectroscopy. The studies of model systems show that interactions between the solute and solvent are important for the electronic structure, and knowledge of the details in model systems studied can be relevant for energy conversion applications. Furthermore, high-level quantum chemistry has been applied for interpreting time-resolved spectra, where the electronic structure of a metal complex is followed during a photoinduced chemical reaction in solution.With advanced modeling in combination with recent experimental developments, more complex problems than previously addressed can be dissected.", "s": [{"ty": 1, "u": "http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:848732"}], "vfn": ""}, "ty": "0", "id": 1823295706, "pk": 1823295706, "weight": 22032, "pc": 0, "cc": 0, "ecc": 0, "logprob": -22.032}, {"y": 2007, "pt": "0", "d": "2007-01-01", "aa": [{"auId": 2034796730, "dAuN": "J.

We find that for the late transition metal systems, the error in the effective spin moment is between 5 and 10%. Because of the potentially large   value, the spin moment can not reliably be determined for all systems other than Ni. The error for 3d 4 systems is very large, implying that, without further information, the derived effective spin sum rule values for 3d 4 systems have no meaning.", "s": [{"ty": 3, "u": "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/190/1/012015/pdf"}], "vfn": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "v": 190, "i": 1, "fp": 12015}, "ty": "0", "id": 2170266449, "pk": 2170266449, "weight": 22220, "pc": 0, "cc": 1, "ecc": 1, "logprob": -22.22}, {"y": 2014, "pt": "0", "d": "2014-06-20", "aa": [{"auId": 2164672846, "dAuN": "Elisa Costantini"}, {"auId": 2131509894, "dAuN": "Cor de Vries"}, {"auId": 2628083967, "dAuN": "Sascha Tamara Zeegers"}, {"auId": 1973428469, "dAuN": "Frank de Groot"}, {"auId": 2791494688, "dAuN": "Harald Mutschke"}], "tac": 7, "f": [{"fId": 555520305, "fn": "milky way"}, {"fId": 190841160, "fn": "cosmic dust"}, {"fId": 2779328170, "fn": "x ray"}, {"fId": 1276947, "fn": "astronomy"}, {"fId": 121332964, "fn": "physics"}], "e": {"dn": "The X-ray side of the absorption by interstellar dust in the Milky Way", "s": [{"ty": 3, "u": "https://pos.sissa.it/207/006/pdf"}], "vfn": "Proceedings of The Life Cycle of Dust in the Universe: Observations, Theory, and Laboratory Experiments \u2014 PoS(LCDU2013)", "v": 207, "fp": 6}, "ty": "0", "id": 2793934459, "pk": 2793934459, "weight": 22764, "pc": 0, "cc": 2, "ecc": 2, "logprob": -22.764}, {"y": 2012, "pt": "0", "d": "2012-01-01", "aa": [{"auId": 1973428469, "dAuN": "Frank de Groot"}, {"auId": 1921709045, "dAuN": "Ludo Juurlink"}, {"auId": 2225539906, "dAuN": "Andrew Beale"}, {"auId": 2048292155, "dAuN": "Emiel Hensen"}, {"auId": 2469100032, "dAuN": "Joost Frenken"}], "tac": 6, "f": [{"fId": 161790260, "fn": "catalysis"}, {"fId": 179104552, "fn": "inorganic chemistry"}, {"fId": 185592680, "fn": "chemistry"}], "e": {"dn": "Mastercourse Catalytic Surface Science 2012", "vfn": ""}, "ty": "0", "id": 2189220145, "pk": 2189220145, "weight": 23617, "pc": 0, "cc": 0, "ecc": 0, "logprob": -23.617}]}
