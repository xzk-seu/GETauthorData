The exchange charge model (ECM) was used to calculate the crystal field parameters (CFP) with taking into account the effects of the covalent bond formation between the Cr3+ and O2\u2212 ions. The calculated CFP values were used for diagonalization of the Cr3+ Hamiltonian in a complete basis set spanned by all wave functions of the LS terms of 3d3 electron configuration. Ab initio calculations (with the CRYSTAL09 computer program) of the density of states allowed evaluating contribution of each ion into the calculated bands. In addition, the spin\u2010polarized calculations allowed for finding difference between densities of the spin\u2010up and spin\u2010down states of 6\u2010fold coordinated Cr3+ ion.

In the present chapter aimed at the students and postgraduates first of all, as well as at the beginners in this field, we review thoroughly the main mechanisms underlying the Ham effect (which means quenching of the spin\u2013orbit interaction due to the interaction of the electronic energy levels with the crystal lattice vibrations). To make the chapter complete from the educational and pedagogical points of view, all necessary mathematical equations needed for calculations are derived and explained. It is shown how the effective second-order spin-Hamiltonian can be used for a description of the Ham effect and estimation of the Jahn\u2013Teller stabilization energy. In addition, an alternative method of determining the Jahn\u2013Teller stabilization energy based on the harmonic approximation and geometrical consideration of the adiabatic surfaces of the potential energy of the ground and excited electronic states is described. The chapter is followed by an attachment with the derivation of the Ham reduction factor.", "s": [{"ty": 1, "u": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03432-9_12"}], "vfn": "", "fp": 347, "lp": 370}, "ty": "0", "id": 103891316, "pk": 103891316, "weight": 23455, "pc": 0, "cc": 1, "ecc": 1, "logprob": -23.455}]}
