They not only show a strong absorption in the near UV to blue-light region of the light spectrum, but also have high quantum efficiency and good thermal and chemical stability compared to oxide and sulphide phosphors [1, 2]. All three MSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ compounds show persistent luminescence, i.e. the light emission continues after excitation of the material has been stopped, but the brightness and the duration of the persistent luminescence is strongly dependent on the host material and the wavelength at which the phosphors are excited. Persistent luminescence is a disadvantage when it comes to applying the materials in a phosphor converted white LED. It was shown that the SrSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ and CaSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ compounds are suitable conversion phosphors in combination with a blue pumping LED because excitation with light in this wavelength range (400 nm < \u03bb < 500 nm) does not result in bright afterglow. For BaSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ persistent luminescence can be induced by exciting the phosphor with light in a broad wavelength range (250 nm < \u03bb < 500 nm) [3]. Next to its persistent luminescent property, BaSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ shows strong luminescence upon mechanical stimulation such as friction or pressure. This phenomenon, known as non destructive mechanoluminescence (ML), is not so common and can be applied in pressure sensing devices. Many similarities are observed between the ML and the persistent luminescence in BaSi2O2N2:Eu . E.g. ML and persistent luminescence emission spectra are identical and show a shift towards longer wavelengths of about 4 nm compared to the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum. This suggests that the radiative recombination path is the same for the mechanoluminescence and the persistent luminescence. Based on the observed ML properties of the phosphor, in combination with information extracted from thermoluminescence excitation spectroscopy measurements, the trap release mechanism is modeled and an energy level scheme for the persistent luminescence and ML in BaSi2O2N2:Eu 2+ is proposed.", "s": [{"ty": 3, "u": "https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/3135277/file/3135310.pdf"}], "vfn": "8th International conference on Luminescent Detectors and Transformers of Ionizing Radiation (LUMDETR 2012)"}, "ty": "0", "id": 2247839652, "pk": 2247839652, "weight": 22553, "pc": 0, "cc": 0, "ecc": 0, "logprob": -22.553}, {"y": 2011, "pt": "0", "d": "2011-01-01", "aa": [{"auId": 2126899833, "dAuN": "Philippe Smet"}, {"auId": 279485865, "dAuN": "Koen Van den Eeckhout"}, {"auId": 2094501317, "dAuN": "Katleen Korthout"}, {"auId": 2193991757, "dAuN": "Jonas Botterman"}, {"auId": 340741872, "dAuN": "Erik Van der Kolk"}], "tac": 8, "f": [{"fId": 2778827800, "fn": "strontium aluminate"}, {"fId": 525727330, "fn": "dysprosium"}, {"fId": 102073756, "fn": "thermoluminescence"}, {"fId": 502696234, "fn": "europium"}, {"fId": 194760766, "fn": "nitride"}, {"fId": 124385694, "fn": "phosphor"}, {"fId": 32891209, "fn": "spectroscopy"}, {"fId": 13965031, "fn": "nuclear chemistry"}, {"fId": 177322064, "fn": "radiochemistry"}, {"fId": 185592680, "fn": "chemistry"}], "e": {"dn": "Charging mechanisms in persistent phosphors", "d": "The development of novel persistent phosphors is currently hampered by a limited understanding of the charging mechanism.

Successful application of feldspar IRSL dating is, however, often precluded due to anomalous-fading, the tunnelling of electrons from one defect site to another. In this paper we test procedures proposed for anomalous-fading correction by comparing feldspar IRSL and quartz OSL dating results on a suite of samples from continental deposits from the southeastern Netherlands. We find that even after anomalous-fading correction IRSL ages underestimate the burial age of the deposits and argue that this may be a consequence of a dependency of anomalous fading rate on the dose rate and on the absorbed dose. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
